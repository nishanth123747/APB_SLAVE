APB Slave Verification using SystemVerilog UVM
This project implements and verifies an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Slave using SystemVerilog and UVM methodology.
The goal is to fully verify the functionality of an APB-compliant slave, including read/write operations, byte strobes, error handling, reset behavior, coverage collection, and assertion-based checks.
